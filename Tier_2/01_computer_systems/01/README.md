## Topic 1 - Introduction to computer architecture
## Homework

### Task

Develop an assembler program that evaluates the arithmetic expression `b - c + a`.

Use as a basis the example program for calculating `a + b - c` presented in the synopsis ([link](https://github.com/goitacademy/Computer-Systems-and-Their-Fundamentals/tree/main/Chapter%2001) to the repository folder to the synopsis), but with the necessary modifications to solve this problem.

### Instructions

1. Study the program code that calculates `a + b - c` given in the outline.
2. Modify the program so that it performs calculations according to the formula `b - c + a`.
3. After making changes to the code, compile and run the program to verify that it correctly evaluates the expression `b - c + a`.
4. Your program should display the calculation result on the screen.
5. After running the program in DOSBox, take a screenshot of the DOSBox window showing the result of your program.

### Acceptance criteria

The program correctly calculates the expression `b - c + a` and displays the calculation result on the screen.
Made and attached a screenshot of the DOSBox window with the displayed result of the program execution.
